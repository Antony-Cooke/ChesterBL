                        From the records in our possession, the Chester Billiards League began in the year 1909.
                        <br>At this time the Mond Challenge Shield was presented for annual competition.
                        <br>From the name itself we presume Mond as we know it today, being part of the ICI company.
                        <br>The first winners of the league in 1909-10 were Chester Unionist Club, later becoming Chester Conservative
                        Club, at that time based upstairs in Newgate Street above the Assembly Rooms, before moving to it's
                        present location in Nicholas Street.
                        <br>In 1933 the Will Thomas Cup was presented for an individual handicap competition again on an annual
                        basis.
                        <br>The first winner being A.C. Townsend.
                        <br>In 1962 C.D. Davies presented a cup to be played for each year individually with no handicap involved;
                        this became the Chester Billiards Championship.
                        <br>The first person to win this competition was Ron Willetts in 1962-3, of Chester Liberal Club, situated
                        upstairs in Nicholas Street, before their move around the corner into Nicholas Street Mews and sadly
                        recent closure.
                        <br>The league matches played each Tuesday throughout the winter are at present played 200 up with four
                        players in each team playing off their allotted individual handicap.
                        <br>There is also a prize for the highest break of the season.
                        <br>This format has changed from past years 1950-60 when at that time more clubs and teams were involved
                        in the league and teams comprised of six players all playing their matches off level with no handicap
                        involved and each game only played 100 up.
                        <br>One year the highest break being 97 made by Phil Williams of YMCA.
                        <br>The Cayzer Cup was presented in 1928 by Sir Charles Cayzer M.P.
                        <br>The first winners being Conservative WMC in 1929.
                        <br>This was for many years a team knockout competition, it is now played at the end of the league season
                        as two small leagues with the winners of each league playing each other for the trophy.
                        <br>Again a changed format due to the reduction of teams playing in the league and to create a continued
                        interest for all concerned.
                        <br>Whilst still part of the Chester and District Billiards and Snooker Leagues and all trophies being
                        owned by this association, together with just one Treasurer, the Billiards League have for some time
                        run their own section with a separate committee and presentation evening.
                        <br>With the unfortunate demise of both billiard and snooker teams registered in the leagues, it obviously
                        needs both sections to continue to support each other in these times.

                    <h6 class="left darkblue two">The records indicate the Chester Snooker League began in 1930 with the first winners being Chester Liberal
                        Club in 1931.
                        <br>Whilst little is known of the early times, from what is remembered in later years (around the 1950's)
                        The C &amp D league fixtures were played as at present on a Friday evening.
                        <br>There was also a Monday League called 'The Temperance League'.
                        <br>This was, as the name suggests, for clubs that did not have the facilities of a bar, for example
                        YMCA, Upton British Legion, PSA (Pleasant Sunday Afternoon), Burrells Shop, Saughall, Eccleston and
                        Handbridge institutes.
                        <br>In later years this was renamed The Monday League and existed as such for some time.
                        <br>The C &amp D league in the 1950's was a team handicap, matches were played on total team aggregate
                        not individual scores, consisting of six players in a team so every player finished their game, the
                        total scores then added, the team handicap deducted from the aggregate of the six games so deciding
                        the result of the match, 2 point awarded for a win.
                        <br>From a cutting taken by Colin Hargreaves (for obvious reasons) in 1982 from The Chester Chronicle,
                        'Snooker &amp Billiards Round-up' it is interesting to note at this time the C &amp D snooker league
                        consisted of four divisions together with the billiard league.
                        <br>There were also two divisions of the Monday league.
                        <br>Many of the teams playing at this time as seen are no longer in existence.
                        <br>During this timescale Harry Drennan (league secretary) was the instigator of forming an inter league
                        competition played on an annual basis, which became very popular.
                        <br>Chester team travelled by coach, helped by league team Crosville Buses, with many supporters to the
                        various locations.
                        <br>The Inter league consisted of teams from Chester, Deeside, Ellesmere Port, Oswestry, Birkenhead,
                        Wallasey, Bromborough and Heswall areas.
                        <br>Chester won this competition several times, although Birkenhead and Wallasey, in general, being the
                        strongest teams.
                        <br>For many years, the only individual snooker competition in the league was the Will Parry cup, played
                        off individual handicaps each season, the first winner being J. Newbrook, St. Francis Church Club,
                        in 1954.
                        <br>In 1961 the league decided to hold the first ever Chester Snooker Championship played off scratch
                        over three frames.
                        <br>The final, over five frames was played at the Bridge Inn Pub, Tarvin Road, Chester.
                        <br>A one table league club at the time, with a large snooker room and surround seating upstairs, this
                        was won by Colin Hargreaves.
                        <br>The league intended to give a prize, but Colin offered to contributed towards this and donated a
                        trophy.
                        <br>The league then named this the Hargreaves Cup.
                        <br>Thereafter Colin entered the competition over the years nine times and managed to win it on each
                        occasion.
                        <br>Over this period in time, the billiards and snooker league presentation evenings were held at Chester
                        Town Hall, with a dinner attended by the Lord Mayor, who presented the prizes.
                        <br>In 2014, due to the cup becoming the worse for wear, Colin provided a replacement.
                        <br>Several league players over the years, who won this trophy, went on to turn professional
                        <br>The most famous of these was James Wattana, born 1970 in Thailand, who came to live in Chester, aged
                        15, staying with Harry Wah, and playing for the YMCA. Winner in 1986.
                        <br>James went on to win the world amateur title in 1988 and turned professional in 1989.
                        <br>He subsequently reached the semi finals of the world professional championships in Sheffield in 1993
                        and 1997.
                        <br>Nick Walker, born 1973 in Chester, now living in Canada, again playing for the YMCA, won the Chester
                        Championship in 1989, 1990 and 1991. He turned professional in 1991 and in 1999, after defeating
                        Dennis Taylor in the prequalifying rounds at Telford, reached the last 16 of the world championship
                        in Sheffield. His match results were as follows:-
                        <br>
                        <br>Rory McLeod 10-6
                        <br>Dennis Taylor 10-3
                        <br>Rod Lawler 10-8

                        <br>Neil Jones, Chester Conservative Club, won the Chester Championship in 1995, 2001, 2002 and 2003.
                        He also joined the professional ranks for several years, before reverting to amateur status.
                        <br>Gareth Allen, Broughton Wings, won the Chester Championship in 2007, 2010 and 2014 and won the honour
                        of turning professional in 2015.
                        <br>The Wrights Pairs Handicap cup was presented to the league for annual competition, the first winners
                        in 1961 being D. Sollars and E. Chadwick, U.S.C.
                        <br>The president of the Billiards and Snooker Leagues for many years was Ron Woodcock who still played
                        for Chester Liberal Club, at the age of 89.

                        The Billiards League is a section of the CDBSL, but because certain administrative matters and

                        <h4> General Rules </h4>
                        <br>
                        <li>There will be a Chairman and a Secretary who will be elected at an Annual General Meeting
                            held before the start of the season on a mutually acceptable date.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The management of the league shall be vested in a committee consisting of the Chairman and
                            Secretary and one representative from each team. Other meetings may be called for specific
                            purposes at times set by the Officers, for example to set and review handicaps or to deal
                            with any disciplinary matters.
                            <br>In these meetings each team representative shall have one vote. The Chairman and
                            Secretary are only entitled to vote if they are representing a team; if necessary the
                            Chairman shall have the casting vote.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Additions or amendments of these rules may only be made at a General Meeting.</li>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Registration</h4>
                        <br>
                        <li>All applications to enter a team in the league shall be made before or at the Annual
                            General Meeting. At a Committee Meeting following the AGM lists of players shall be
                            submitted for registration and handicapping. Further registrations may be submitted up to
                            31 December; in exceptional circumstances additional registrations may be requested after
                            this date for consideration by the committee.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>A player may not represent more than one team in the league season. Anyone registered for a
                            team for which he has not played in that season may apply to be transferred to another team
                            at the discretion of the management committee. In very special circumstances, a player
                            having already played for one team may apply to the committee for permission to transfer to
                            another team.</li>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Finance</h4>
                        <br>
                        <li>All fees will be paid directly to the <b>C&amp;DB&amp;S Treasurer</b>.</li>
                        <br>
                        <h4>League Match Rules</h4>
                        <br>
                        <li>Start time for matches will be: One table 7.00pm - Two tables 7.30pm</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The Rules of Billiards as issued by the EABA shall apply unless otherwise stated.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Players will be handicapped using League results using the following system:
                            <br>
                            <br>Each player will be allocated a handicap at the start of the season. This handicap will
                            be adjusted on a match by match basis. If a player wins, his handicap will be reduced 5
                            points. If a player loses, his handicap is increased by 5 points. The new handicap will
                            then be used for the player's following match.
                            <br>
                            <br>New players will be allocated an initial handicap based on any relevant information
                            from Clubs, other players or other Leagues. Their handicap will then be adjusted as
                            detailed in the paragraph above.
                            <br>
                            <br>The handicap that a player has attained at the end of the League season will then be
                            used for all Cayzer Cup matches and will then be carried forward to the start of the
                            following League Season.
                            <br>
                            <br>The winner of the Will Thomas Cup and the player(s) with the most wins in the
                            League will have his handicap reduced by 10 points for the start of the following League
                            Season. The runner-up of the Will Thomas Cup will have his handicap reduced by 5 points.
                            <br>
                            <br>The maximum handicap will be +115
                            <br>
                            <br>The committee will have the power to review a players handicap at any stage should they
                            believe there are exceptional circumstances.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Each team will consist of four players and each game will be 200 up played off the set
                            handicap.
                            <br>
                            <br>If a team is a player short the non-offending team shall win the game 200-0. No handicap
                            will be adjusted for any unplayed game</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>In determining the order of play where there are two tables, the home captain will nominate
                            the first two players which the away captain will match with two of his team; in the case
                            of one table clubs, players will be nominated in order. For team matches on neutral tables
                            each captain will list their playing order independently.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>In all games the players will string for break. The winner will decide who breaks off.
                            However, the home player shall play with the yellow ball and will be marked as spot at the
                            top of the scoreboard.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Stalemate Rule: If, during a game, the referee decides that a stalemate has been reached,
                            he will allow each player three further shots. If the issue is still not resolved, the red
                            ball shall be respotted and the players will string as at the beginning of a game. The
                            scores will continue from the point of the stalemate.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Two points will be awarded for each game won and two points for the highest aggregate; in
                            the event of a tied aggregate each team will receive one point.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>If teams finish on level points at the end of the season, a play off match will be arranged
                            at a neutral venue on a mutually acceptable date.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Matches may only be postponed in exceptional circumstances. A match may be brought forward
                            if agreed by the two teams and the Secretary must immediately be informed. In rearranging a
                            match at a future date the postponing team must give 72 hours notice to the opponents and
                            the non-offending team shall give three dates during the 14 days following the scheduled
                            match date. The postponing team must accept one of these dates (or agree an alternative
                            within the 14 days) or the matter will be referred to the committee. The Secretary must be
                            kept fully informed of all these proceedings.</li>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Cayzer Cup Competition</h4>
                        <br>
                        <li>Teams which have not played in the league must apply, with names of the players, and be
                            accepted by the committee. Standard league rules will apply apart from the following.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The format of the competition will be confirmed at the start of each season.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>The result of each match will be on aggregate only with two points being awarded for a win
                            and one point each for a draw.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Should teams be level on points at the end of the competition the winner will be decided on
                            total aggregate point difference.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>In the final on neutral tables, captains will list their players from 1 to 4 and the
                            organiser will number the tables 1 and 2. Numbers 1 and 3 players will play on table 1 and

                        <h4>Will Thomas Cup Competition</h4>
                        <br>
                        <li>This is an individual KO competition played off league handicaps and all games will be 200
                            up. The handicap at the beginning of the first round will apply throughout the competition.
                            <br>
                            <br>For both these competitions initial rounds will be drawn, home or away; semifinals and
                            finals will be played on neutral tables.</li>

                            (not shorts) and shoes. In no circumstances will collarless shirts, jeans or trainers be
                            acceptable.
                            <br>
                            <br>In individual competitions i.e. the Davies and Will Thomas Cups, any transgression will
                            result in the offending player being eliminated from the competition and the game awarded
                            to his opponent.
                            <br>
                            <br>In the Cayzer Cup team competition, the offending player will forfeit his game and his
                            opponent will score 200 points; the offending player will score the amount of his handicap
                            (positive or negative).</li>
